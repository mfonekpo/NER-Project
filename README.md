# NER Project with Spacy

### Description
I stumbled upon a dataset of over 47k rows, this dataset had just one column which was a collation of news headlines from different news outlet. Prior to this, I had been practicing NLP with Spacy, being conversant with text cleaning and preprocessing. Then, an idea came to me, why not extract named entities from this dataset and create a wordcloud for every entitiy. Please if you do not know what a wordcloud is, I would advice you look into it and it's uses.


## AIM:
The goal of this project was to perfect my textcleaning and preprocessing skills, being comfortable to work with unstructured data such as text. Any developer can choose to contribute to this project in any way possible. Feel free to dive into it.

### Entities:
***Persons:*** I was curious about the number of persons that was involved or mentioned in the whole dataset.

***Organizations:*** I wanted to know the organizations which were named all over the news headlines.

***Locations:*** The locations mentioned most on the dataset.

***Summary:*** And lastly, I was interested to as what the news headlines were all about, thus, I created a wordcloud of the entire dataset without having to sepereate the aforementioned entities.
